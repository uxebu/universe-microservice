And the transition to it from require?","text":"here my highlevel advantages for browserify:\n\n- predictable build results with a really simple build setup. browserify entry.js (+ transforms). This method is very easy to understand. Fiddling with requirejs path configurations is just a pain!\n- that the differentiation between node / browser module is gone (as pete higgins always said: it's just javascript)\n- because this differentiation is gone i can execute my tests in node (faster and much more simple than setting up a browser test runner: mocha my-spec.js)\n- because i run my tests in node it will pinpoint me to the issues where I relied on a browser global and it automatically tells me that I probably should inject that dependency properly. For me this is a huge helper for doing DI and moving away from integration tests. It makes it much more obvious.\n- realizing browser dependencies helps me to push those dependencies to the boundaries of the application (mostly the bootstrap) and it automatically makes the code reusable in any js environment (and those are and will be everywhere :))\n- big hope for me is, that npm will be THE JS package manager that is used everywhere so that we can get rid of all those messie proprietary / github-based package managers (I'm looking at you: bower, component, volo, webpack). NPM is simple and all the others are not or they lack robustness / proper standardization. Big missing feature for NPM is on its way https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5239 and when that is solved you can easily use private npm dependencies.\n- minor advantage: deps are more easy to read and your code does not need to be indented by 2\n- also minor / opinionated: I like the explicteness of module.exports"},"event":"comment","tags":[":url","influx:4823350","kb","browserify"],"id":4823754,"sent":1402040845042,"edited":null,"attachments":[],"uuid":"iI78KwZ_mrffhKbf","app":"chat","flow":"uxebu:main"},{"user":"9475","content":{"title":"@david one of this Kind You definetly have in your tool belt too http://blog.mayflower.de/4842-git-rebase-vs-git-merge.html please share","text":"https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer"},"event":"comment","tags":[":url","influx:4862211","kb"],"id":4863367,"sent":1403601250691,"edited":null,"attachments":[],"uuid":"Y4qbHlRypxvZ_3HU","app":"chat","flow":"uxebu:main"},{"user":"9468","content":{"title":"@david one of this Kind You definetly have in your tool belt too http://blog.mayflower.de/4842-git-rebase-vs-git-merge.html please share","text":"so lets make the tag #kb for knowledge base come back to life!"},"event":"comment","tags":["kb","influx:4862211"],"id":4864266,"sent":1403610474732,"edited":null,"attachments":[],"uuid":"Eo3VWFUiPnyJG0dH","app":"chat","flow":"uxebu:main"},{"user":"12054","content":"http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture #teststrategy #adapter #kb","event":"message","tags":["teststrategy","adapter",":url","kb"],"id":4864407,"sent":1403612840431,"edited":1403618245147,"attachments":[],"uuid":"Q4XuDE1t88S_UCoY","app":"chat","flow":"uxebu:main"},{"user":"12054","content":"http://javascriptjabber.com/081-jsj-promises-for-testing-async-javascript-with-pete-hodgson/ #kb #testing #podcast","event":"message","tags":["testing","podcast",":url","kb"],"id":4864414,"sent":1403612884190,"edited":1403618252347,"attachments":[],"uuid":"9t5ehYxJ41DzCUgp","app":"chat","flow":"uxebu:main"},{"user":"12054","content":"http://javascriptjabber.com/043-jsj-sinon-js/ #kb #testing #podcast","event":"message","tags":["testing","podcast",":url",":thread","kb"],"id":4864429,"sent":1403613008889,"edited":1403618273266,"attachments":[],"uuid":"xlmuiQYMg-hq-2Gp","app":"chat","flow":"uxebu:main"},{"user":"9469","content":{"title":"http://javascriptjabber.com/043-jsj-sinon-js/ #hg #testing #podcast","text":"http://javascriptjabber.com/075-jsj-maintainable-javascript-with-nicholas-zakas/ #podcast #js-in-teams"},"event":"comment","tags":[":url","influx:4864429","podcast","js-in-teams","kb"],"id":4864443,"sent":1403613072611,"edited":1403613098696,"attachments":[],"uuid":"VGt7sbSS8sWlrvA1","app":"chat","flow":"uxebu:main"},{"user":"9469","content":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9quxZsLcfo #kb","event":"message","tags":[":url","kb","tdd","video"],"id":4864486,"sent":1403613312100,"edited":1403613331259,"attachments":[],"uuid":"iPYVFp1hL3sDYuLp","app":"chat","flow":"uxebu:main"},{"user":"0","content":{"coordinates":null,"retweeted":false,"source":"<a href=\"http://twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web Client</a>","entities":{"user_mentions":[],"urls":[{"url":"http://t.co/5jufRAQub0","expanded_url":"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html","display_url":"martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRe\u2026","indices":[50,72]}],"symbols":[],"hashtags":[],"trends":[]},"favorite_count":0,"in_reply_to_status_id_str":null,"geo":null,"id_str":"481798233338150912","in_reply_to_user_id":null,"truncated":false,"text":"That's the reason why it is called Chrome Canary?
